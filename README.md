# unity-sticky-notes
I saw a tweet from [Gareth Noyce](https://medium.com/@TripleEhLtd/in-game-sticky-notes-c5f4013892f6) about some functionality he implemented for use in his new game. It's based on Nintendo's bug notes for Zelda Breath of the Wild and I had to try implementing it in Unity.

Purpose:
* Bake bug reporting directly into your game
* Illustrate to fellow developers where the issues are

See TODO.md for the plan / video schedule.
